## Environment

- [ ] sass
  Ruby Sass has reached end-of-life and should no longer be used.

  * If you use Sass as a command-line tool, we recommend using Dart Sass, the new
    primary implementation: https://sass-lang.com/install

  * If you use Sass as a plug-in for a Ruby web framework, we recommend using the
    sassc gem: https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby#readme

  * For more details, please refer to the Sass blog:
